            <h3>Details</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You will receive an e-invoice every 30 days via your registered email. This invoice will assess the cost of anticipated sessions in the upcoming month based on your current schedule.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any canceled lessons may be rescheduled on alternate days. If you prefer not to reschedule, the extra payment will be applied to the next monthâ€™s classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                No additional invoices will be issued until you have exhausted payments already made.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Make the Payment?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Except for the first invoice, all payments are made monthly in advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                The first invoice will be issued after you have indicated satisfaction with the first lesson with your assigned teacher.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Transfer Fees</h3>
            <p>
              We add a maximum fee of $5.00 USD on the total amount of each invoice, regardless of the amount you send. This charge covers the PayPal usage fees that all parties incur in making and accepting payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example Invoice:</strong><br>
              Total hours at $10 USD per hour plus the transfer fee:<br>
              15 hours X $10 = $150 + $5 = ($155 Total)
            </p>
            <p>
              You may make early payments using one of our approved payment methods, such as PayPal, or request an early payment invoice.
            </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                In cases of errors on our part, Late Fees will be waived or refunded. If you miss a payment, contact us immediately to discuss how the payment can be made.
